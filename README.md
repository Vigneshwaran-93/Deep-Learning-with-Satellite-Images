## Understanding NVID:
### Overview
The **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** is a widely used metric in remote sensing to assess vegetation health and density. This project provides a simple implementation of the NDVI calculation using satellite imagery data.
NDVI is calculated using reflectance measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) and red spectral bands. It is particularly effective for monitoring vegetation health and can be applied in various fields such as agriculture, forestry, and ecology.

$$
NDVI = \frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED}
$$

Where:
- **NIR**: Reflectance in the near-infrared spectrum.
- **RED**: Reflectance in the red spectrum.
- This formula yields values ranging from -1 to 1:
- Values close to 1 indicate dense, healthy vegetation.
- Values around 0 suggest barren areas or sparse vegetation.
- Negative values (approaching -1) typically correspond to water bodies.
## Applications
NDVI can be applied in various fields, including:
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring crop health and estimating yields.
- **Forestry**: Assessing forest cover and health.
- **Ecology**: Studying vegetation dynamics and ecosystem changes.
